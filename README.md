# Local-Hack-Day-2018

Today is Saturday, December 1st, 2018.

Welcome to the GitHub page for Stetson University's MLH Local Hack Day 2018, sponsored by GitHub and brought to you by Stetson's HackerSpace!

Here, you will push your work for demos and judging at the end of the hackathon.

**Hacking begins at 9:30am. Please _do not_ make a commit to this GitHub before then.**

**Hacking ends at 7:30pm. Please _do not_ make a commit to this GitHub after then.**

## Submitting Your Project
To submit your project, move all of your work into a new folder, give the folder the name you'd like to give your project, and push the entire folder to this GitHub page. 

If you are submitting a project as a team, please have only one of your teammates push the project to this GitHub page on your team's behalf.

**_Do not_ make edits to any project that is not your own.**

After submitting your project, add your project name and description to this README, along with the names and schools of everyone who contributed to the project! We must give credit where credit is due!

We encourage you to keep working on your project after this hackathon ends. If you choose to do so, please do not push the changes you make to your project to this GitHub page. We want this page to solely reflect the work done during the hacking time period. 

Do not forget to take a look at the Global Local Hack Day Challenges as well for a chance to win $25 Gift Cards to the GitHub swag shop! Visit the following link for more details: https://mlh-local-hack-day-2018.devpost.com/ .
